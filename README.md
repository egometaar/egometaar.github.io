Free and Open “Blender Augmented Reality Nano Film Festival”!
Launch yourself solo or in collaboration to create your own augmented reality nano film experience using Blender

 Hi, I’m Ego, the creator of this project. I want to tell you a personal story that motivated me to do this. A few years ago, I was diagnosed with post-pandemic depression, a condition that affected many people after the global health crisis. I felt sad, lonely and without any purpose in life. Then I found Pierrick Picaut on the internet and his course “Alive! Blender animation course”, and this course saved my life. Thanks Pierrick and thanks Blender. Ego… 

This experience made me realize the power and the potential of Blender, the free and open source software for 3D content creation. I decided to use it to create something amazing and innovative: a nano film in augmented reality. I called it a "Blender AR Nano Film", and I want to share it with you and invite you to participate in a free and open festival of "Blender AR Nano Films".

Mark the difference! Would you like to use Augmented Reality to bring your BLENDER projects to life and show them at the “Free Opening "Blender AR Nano Film" Festival”?

Make your own "Blender AR Nano Film":

A "Blender AR Nano Film" is an awesome and innovative resource that allows you to create immersive and impactful experiences that capture the attention and emotion of the audience, generating greater engagement with the artist and memory of a 3D production. 

A Blender Augmented Reality (Blender AR) experience is a free and open source, WebAR experience, which is activated by simply using your cell phone and clicking on a link, without the need to scan QR codes, use AR development software, install applications or use social networks. It is 100% optimized, high-quality and high-performance for Augmented Reality on the Web.

If you use Blender, and you are a digital artist, an illustrator, a designer, an animator, a teacher, a writer, a musician or a creative, this initiative is for you. I'm sure you can create some amazing "Blender AR Nano Films".
No matter if you are an expert or a novice, all you need is the desire to create and share. The important thing is that you have fun. If you already know how to use the tools, great. If you want to learn, even better, we will help you. You just have to be willing to use them. For example:

We can teach you how to use multiple rigging/armatures in a single AR scene using the NLA editor easily. The NLA editor is the non-linear animation editor, which allows you to combine actions and edit multiple animations in Blender. You can use it to create complex, realistic scenes with your 3D models and to control how they interact with the AR environment. Watch the final result...
We can show you how to achieve high definition textures using a way to “simulate” the node editor structure for complex materials, in a single texture image; fundamental in WebAR. By simulating the structure of nodes in Photoshop or Krita, you can create high-definition textures that are compatible with glTF and WebAR, and that look as good as the ones created with Blender. This is really fun and easy. Watch the final result...
We can help you configure and optimize the export of your 3D models to glTF, the standard format for Augmented Reality on the Web. We can explain how to adjust the export parameters, how to reduce file sizes and how to solve any possible problems you may have. In addition, we can teach you some skills that some experts have, for instance, how to export normal maps correctly. Watch the final result...
We can give you some advice to optimize your meshes and enhance the performance of your Augmented Reality scenes. We can show you some mesh optimization techniques, which are uncommon methods to create details on the surfaces while keeping the number of vertices low. Watch the final result...
And much more ...

We can provide you with some extra resources, such as MindAR, the open source library for Augmented Reality on the Web, which allows you to use image tracking to place your 3D objects in the real world. We can also give you some code examples for three.js, a JavaScript library for creating and adjusting 3D on the web. Additionally, we can help you deploy your project on GitHub, the platform for hosting and sharing code. Finally, we can offer you tips for creative writing using artificial intelligence (GPT-3), which can help you generate ideas, dialogues, narrations and titles for your "Blender AR Nano Films".

And of course, everything necessary to generate the target image and the final composition of your art, ready for the marker gallery of your "Blender AR Nano Film" for the Free Opening of the "Blender AR Nano Film" Festival. Watch the final result...

If you are interested in learning this and much more, please let us know so we can help you.
